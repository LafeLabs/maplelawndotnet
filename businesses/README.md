To add a page for a business, go to the page list.html by clicking on the icon on this page that looks like this:

![](iconsymbols/tree.svg)

Then put in the name of the business page you want to add in the "page" field and click on the link that appears.  Click on all subsequent links that appear, then edit the page to have appropriate information about that business(hours, menu, link to the official page etc.)  Then add a link to that page from various other pages, such as map pages, directly neighboring businesses, similar businesses, or whatever. Note that links are added using the Markdown language that all this text is in using square brackets for the text and parentheses for the link:

<pre>
[text](link)
</pre>

[link up a level](../)
