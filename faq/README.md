# FAQ(Frequently Asked Questions)

**What is this page all about?**This page is an experiment in free, open, self-replicating web media.  Every page here contains code that can replicate it across the Internet.  Every page can be edited, including completely deleted by anyone.  It can also by copied by anyone, edited, and copied again etc.  It consists of some very simple web code, designed to be as minimalist as possible. You can edit all the code right here on the server.

**who wrote this?**I'm a Maple Lawn local.  I hang out at Sidamo and work down the road at a lab. If you're at all interested in learning more about this software please email me at lafelabs[at]gmail.com, and I can meet up at Sidamo for a demo and explanation of how the code works.


**what is this for?**This page is for local information sharing in the physical location of Maple Lawn.  This is not a place to put outward facing information that might turn up in a search engine or business type site.  Rather it is an informal, geographically-based collection of bulletin boards, meme pages and maps to help people actually in Maple Lawn on a day to day basis share information.  

**What information should I *not* put on this network?**Do not put anything on here which is secret, private, personal, classified, proprietary, or illegal.  Assume anything you put on here will get deleted and can be copied and archived by anyone.

**how can I get involved and learn more?**Email me at lafelabs[at]gmail.com and I'll show you how to make your own pages, how to edit the code, how to make more pages like this, etc.  Once you know how to add pages to the network and edit pages, just add content and spread the word.

**Is this a company/business/startup?**No.  There is no business, I'm not trying to make money here or start a company this is just an experiment in free software and local networking.  This is not some kind of stealth marketing campaign it's just some free web pages.


**I don't like something I've seen on the network, and have a problem with it.**Anything you see on the network can be deleted once you understand how the software works.  I can teach you this, I'll be posting tutorials, but if you see something harmful on the network and don't want to learn the software email the creator of this page and I'll manually delete it for you.

**How can I use this network to help my local Maple Lawn business make more money? Or place an ad here?**Unlike search engines which are for profit businesses, this is just a free page with links on it.  As a hobby, users of the network will be adding links to businesses.
